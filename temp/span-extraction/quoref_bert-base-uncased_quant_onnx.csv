[SEP] shortly after michael's birth, the family moved to wetherden in suffolk. michael's education began in 1909, with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a curriculum that included piano lessons — his first formal contact with music. there was a piano in the house, on which he "" took to improvising crazily... which i called'composing ', though i had only the vaguest notion of what that meant "". in september 1914 michael became a boarder at brookfield preparatory school in swanage, dorset. he spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of god. in 1918 he won a scholarship to fettes college, a boarding school in edinburgh, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the pipe organ. the school was not a happy place ; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. when michael revealed to his parents in march 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him. he transferred to stamford school in lincolnshire, where a decade previously malcolm sargent had been a pupil. around this time henry tippett decided to live in france, and the house in wetherden was sold. the 15 - year - old michael and his brother peter remained at school in england, travelling to france for their holidays. michael found stamford much more congenial than fettes, and developed both academically and musically. he found an inspiring piano teacher in frances tinkler, who introduced him to the music of bach, beethoven, schubert and chopin. sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when tippett and another boy played a c minor concerto for two harpsichords by bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. tippett sang in the chorus when sargent directed a local performance of robert planquette's operetta les cloches de corneville. despite his parents'wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to cambridge university, tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by sargent. by mid - 1922 tippett",87108e290e1de40a4e3cc4d1aa08f7a392242103,quoref,What is the last name of the person who revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy?,"Shortly after Michael's birth, the family moved to Wetherden in Suffolk.
