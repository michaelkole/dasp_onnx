It covers 55,500 ha (214 sq mi) and is centered on the Marojejy Massif, a mountain chain that rises to an elevation of 2,132 m (6,995 ft).  Access to the area around the massif was restricted to research scientists when the site was set aside as a strict nature reserve in 1952.  In 1998, it was opened to the public when it was converted into a national park.  It became part of the World Heritage Site known as the Rainforests of the Atsinanana in 2007.  Despite its rugged terrain, poaching and selective logging are still persistent problems, particularly since the start of the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar.  Mining, slash-and-burn agriculture, and wood collection also pose threats to the park and its wildlife.
The wide range of elevations and rugged topography of the massif create diverse habitats that transition quickly with changes in altitude.  Warm, dense rainforest can be found at lower elevations, followed by shorter forests at higher elevations, followed still by cloud forest, and topped near the peaks with the only remaining undisturbed mountain scrub in Madagascar.  Better growing conditions for plants can be found on the eastern side of the mountains, which receives more rain than the western side.  This habitat diversity lends itself to high levels of biodiversity.  At least 118 species of bird, 148 species of reptile and amphibian, and 11 species of lemur are known to occur within Marojejy National Park.  One of the lemurs, the silky sifaka (Propithecus candidus) is listed among ""The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates"".  The helmet vanga (Euryceros prevostii) is considered the iconic bird species of the park.
One path leads from the entrance of the park to the summit.

In the following months, Love was rarely seen in public, holing up in her Seattle home with friends and family members. After the cremation of Cobain's remains, Love divided portions of his ashes, keeping some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. In June 1994, she traveled to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York, where she had his ashes ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks, and a portion were mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures. On June 16, 1994, Hole's bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose in Seattle. For the band's impending tour, Love recruited Canadian bassist Melissa Auf der Maur.Live Through This was a commercial and critical success, hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades. The success of the record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in a high level of publicity for Love,",9678ac4dd9f1925e9ac9dee6f8fcedc7381871dd,quoref,What is the name of the person who reportedly broke out into Tourette syndrome-like rants at the band's show in Boston in December 1994?,"On September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the R","{'answer_start': [2721], 'text': ['Love']}"

At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students ""amateurish and folksy"" and the staff ""inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere"". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be ""an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength""; Britten was not, and learned little from him. He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for ""nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence"".Britten",fa1db8f846266b7b59cd15723c82301aef85a8df,quoref,What is the name of the person who intended postgraduate study in Vienna with Alban Berg?,"In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk.

Britten was not enthusiastic about the prospect of working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.
Britten became a member of the film unit's small group of regular contributors, another of whom was W. H. Auden. Together they worked on the documentary films Coal Face and Night Mail in 1935. They also collaborated on the song cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including Cabaret Songs, On This Island, Paul Bunyan and Hymn to St. Cecilia. Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, ""cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous""; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.In the three years from 1935 to 1937 Britten wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio. Among the film music of the late 1930s Matthews singles out Night Mail and Love from a Stranger (1937); from the theatre music he selects for mention  The Ascent of F6 (1936), On the Frontier (1938) and Johnson Over Jordan (1939); and of the music for radio, King Arthur (1937) and The Sword in the Stone (1939).In 1937 there were two events of huge importance in Britten's",77ddc8c4ef3148aad3875786d0db71b7c875e024,quoref,"What is the name of the person that their best known compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra,","In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten was invited to a job interview by the B","{'answer_start': [43], 'text': ['Britten']}"

She tells Jakob, her adolescent son, that another woman will come, a woman who will love him, and that the next words he speaks will call Malvina back to him.
Seven months later a British nurse specializing in children's care, Verena, arrives. Jakob hasn't spoken since his mother died and Verena is the latest English-speaking (per Malvina's wishes) nurse recruited by Klaus, Jakob's father. Verena meets estate keeper Alessio and retired house maid Lilia. Though polite, Jakob is cold and distant.
Verena learns that Malvina's family owned the estate and surrounding quarries for 1,200 years. Malvina was the first descendant not to run the quarry, instead becoming a world famous pianist. Since most of the men who worked there died during the second world war, she allowed the quarry to flood, though Alessio still lights a flame for long-dead quarrymen, proclaiming ""Life. Death. Love. The stone was everything."" 
When Verena looks in on Jakob one night, she finds him with his ear to the stone wall in his room, listening. Klaus fears that Jakob believes he can hear Malvina in the stone. Verena worries that she is inadequate and that Jakob's condition requires a mental health specialist.
When Verena sees Jakob on the ledge of a tall tower, she endangers herself to rescue him – making her (and Jakob) realize that she cares for him and must stay to help him.  She caringly explains that the voice he hears is real, but that it is just his mind playing tricks on him.

According to Wolfgang Rathert, Hindemith ""sought to moderate Reger's 'uncontrolled invention'"", while Kirshnit described Reger's original scoring as ""gloriously polychromatic"". Hindemith ""thinned"" the orchestra, especially the horns. In Reger's scoring, the organ reinforced the voices throughout the piece, resulting in a lack of clarity for the polyphonic passages. Hindemith used the organ only for climaxes. In the double fugue, he assigned one theme to a voice, but the other simultaneous theme to the orchestra. Hindemith's approach, which enables more analytical listening, seems justified by Reger's own scoring of later compositions which were more refined and focused. It is probably due to his version that Der 100. Psalm enjoyed continuous presence in concert halls, while other works by Reger were neglected.François Callebout wrote an organ version that was published in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer explains in the preface that Reger's work was conceived for oratorio choirs of up to 500 singers at the beginning of the 20th century. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. This version was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by Ignace Michiels, organist at the St. Salvator Cathedral in Bruges.Hanns-Friedrich Kaiser, KMD (director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger",e65b7f6bb119a7f23670bed2d10ba66d5299946c,quoref,"What is the last name of the person that in 2012 performed a new version of the composition that was an ""uncontrolled invention""?","In 1955, Paul Hindemith revised the work to achieve more clarity.

After finishing a contract killing, Joshua is ordered to kill an Iranian jeweler in Brighton Beach, which Joshua reluctantly accepts. Joshua stands outside his family's apartment, where he is spotted by one of his old friends Sasha, who tells Joshua's brother Reuben the next day. Reuben goes to the hotel where Joshua is staying to see him. Joshua asks Reuben how he knew he was in Brighton, and they make plans to meet again the next day.
Joshua waits near the boardwalk where Sasha is and intimidates him to tell who else knows about Joshua being in Brighton. Sasha brings Joshua to the car repair
stand where Viktor and Yuri are. Joshua says they will help him find the Iranian jeweler and when they refuse, Joshua threatens them.
After things go sour, Joshua executes a man at a phone booth to prevent being found out in Brighton, which angers the neighborhood boss Boris Volkoff. Joshua starts dating his ex-girlfriend Alla. Alla asks Reuben if he has seen Joshua anywhere and the three go together to see a movie. Eventually Reuben takes Joshua home to see his parents again, but Arkady denounces him as a murderer and kicks him out.

The symphony, written in the manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen ""the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello"".   The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in ""finding a sound"" that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments  perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.
 
Tippett described the longest and most ambitious of his late works, the oratorio The Mask of Time (1982), as ""a pageant of sorts  with an ultimately lofty message"". Mellers called the work ""a mind-boggling cosmic history of the universe"".   Paul Driver, who had been a critic of Tippett's new style, wrote that the Mask  revealed ""the authentic early Tippett"", with a return to the lyricism of The Midsummer Marriage and multiple acknowledgements of his early compositions.Tippett had intended The Ice Break",e0cc7a2f27501502654bd6c47e815ecd03dc080b,quoref,What work was described as a worthy ending to a remarkable career in Tippett's Daily Telegraph obituary??,In the late 1970s Tippett produced three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony ,"{'answer_start': [2380], 'text': ['The Rose Lake']}"

To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000 lb of which was prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1977 from French beet harvests.The results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of 12C, 13C, and 14C, which are used to calculate Fm, the ""fraction modern"". This is defined as the ratio between the 14C/12C ratio in the sample and the 14C/12C ratio in modern carbon, which is in turn defined as the 14C/12C ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.Both beta counting and AMS results have to be corrected for fractionation. This is necessary because different materials of the same age, which because of fractionation have naturally different 14C/12C ratios, will appear to be of different ages because the 14C/12C ratio is taken as the indicator of age. To avoid this, all radiocarbon measurements are converted to the measurement that would have been seen had the sample been made of wood, which has a known δ13C value of −25‰.Once the corrected 14C/12C ratio is known, a ""radiocarbon age",ca675c7d6e8dd6868e42986a5493f6338b82b64d,quoref,"What calculation uses 8,033, the mean-life derived from Libby's half-life of 5,568 years?","The calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, ","{'answer_start': [1749], 'text': ['radiocarbon age']}"

The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent.
While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She also appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia.
