"" mercury "" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. the track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance, effects okereke has called "" harsh, glacial, layered and energetic "". "" zephyrus "" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern, while the exmoor singers provide background vocals in the rest of the composition. "" signs "" is the only song that does not include guitars ; instead, it is made up of a synthesiser pulse and multitracked samples of glockenspiel and mbira resembling the work of minimalist composer steve reich. okereke has conceded that intimacy covers bloc party's typical indie rock elements, but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, "" almost like all the humanity has been bleached out "". "" halo "" has a fast tempo coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four chords, while "" trojan horse "" features syncopated guitars and distortion. "" talons "" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars, while the final single "" one month off "" consists of tribal rhythms and sixteenth note guitar riffs. "" biko "" has a slower tempo and includes guitar arpeggi throughout, while "" ion square "" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of hi - hat patterns throughout. according to nick southall",04c9af1290574970e75c1426ab41df12a4691232,quoref,What is the full name of the person that states that the track featuring broken beats and layered vocals encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works?,Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more ,"{'answer_start': [1790], 'text': ['Nick Southall']}"
