He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot.
His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene.
But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas.

His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene.

She wasn't marrying him just because he was a nice guy. She truly had the hots for him.
It was Thursday night, 6:20 PM. Greg and Cynthia were finishing up a run-through of the ceremony at First Baptist Church, Coreyville, where Greg was part-time music director. They were well on their way to happily ever after. Everything was perfect.

Larry had never used a prostitute. He'd always thought of it as revolting. The idea of having sex with a woman who'd been with hundreds of men did not appeal to him.

But she didn't deserve one. So instead, he would dump her ashes into the rusty 55-gallon garbage drum on the other side of the dirt road.
His brain articulated the scene at hyper-speed, overloading his sixty-words-per-minute hands. It was so easy--just like the murder.
Wait. Not that easy, he thought. It wasn't as though he was simply taking dictation. No, not at all. He was a craftsman, an artist. He had six novels worth of experience under his belt. This time his writing was much better--but only because he had a better story idea. It was still fiction.
He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot.
His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene.
But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas.

So, this time around Cynthia was looking for something different. Greg was kind and thoughtful and funny. And regardless of what Greg thought, she did find him attractive--even on their first meeting. And the more she got to know him, the more attractive he became.

He jittered with excitement at the realization of what he had just done. His clothing reeked of smoke from Erin's incineration. Hopefully by morning her remains would fit in an urn. But she didn't deserve one. So instead, he would dump her ashes into the rusty 55-gallon garbage drum on the other side of the dirt road.
His brain articulated the scene at hyper-speed, overloading his sixty-words-per-minute hands. It was so easy--just like the murder.
Wait. Not that easy, he thought. It wasn't as though he was simply taking dictation. No, not at all. He was a craftsman, an artist. He had six novels worth of experience under his belt. This time his writing was much better--but only because he had a better story idea. It was still fiction.
He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot.
His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene.
But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas.

He wouldn't have been surprised if Cupid himself had flown in to break up the crazy mismatch.
But Cynthia saw something in Greg she couldn't resist. Something she should have looked for in the eyes of her first groom. Troy was a rugged, handsome man. Nothing wrong with that. But he was also an abuser. And all the love he'd ever given her meant nothing after that first brutal slap across the face. Then came the boozing and hitting and steady barrage of obscenities.
So, this time around Cynthia was looking for something different. Greg was kind and thoughtful and funny. And regardless of what Greg thought, she did find him attractive--even on their first meeting. And the more she got to know him, the more attractive he became. She wasn't marrying him just because he was a nice guy. She truly had the hots for him.

It was Thursday night, and she could have been in their backyard, sitting by the pool in an ultra-skimpy bikini, drinking and laughing with her friends. Like every other night.
She walked in and slammed the door. ""Okay, I'm here. Now, will you please tell me why it was so important for me to drive all the way up here tonight? You know I hate this place. And I had to cancel my party.""
Larry glanced over at his super-hot 25-year-old girlfriend. Her body could still blow away most of the competition at a Miss America Pageant. ""I'll explain. Just sit down and chill.""
He looked back at his laptop. Larry wasn't a bad-looking 30-year old, if you could see past the scruffy beard and the long stringy hair.
She walked up behind him. ""Who's that?""
""It's a girl I went to high school with.""
""What about the guy?""
Larry didn't answer. He just puffed on his pipe.
Erin backed away. She hated his smoking, but he didn't care. ""Why am I here, Larry? This place stinks like dead fish.""
Larry kept his eyes on his laptop screen. ""Well, this is a fish camp. But I do my best writing up here.""

He knew he didn't deserve her. Anybody could see that. He saw himself as a balding, average-looking 35-year-old. Cynthia was a strikingly beautiful 30-year-old redhead. He wouldn't have been surprised if Cupid himself had flown in to break up the crazy mismatch.
But Cynthia saw something in Greg she couldn't resist. Something she should have looked for in the eyes of her first groom. Troy was a rugged, handsome man. Nothing wrong with that. But he was also an abuser. And all the love he'd ever given her meant nothing after that first brutal slap across the face. Then came the boozing and hitting and steady barrage of obscenities.
So, this time around Cynthia was looking for something different. Greg was kind and thoughtful and funny. And regardless of what Greg thought, she did find him attractive--even on their first meeting. And the more she got to know him, the more attractive he became. She wasn't marrying him just because he was a nice guy. She truly had the hots for him.
It was Thursday night, 6:20 PM. Greg and Cynthia were finishing up a run-through of the ceremony at First Baptist Church, Coreyville, where Greg was part-time music director. They were well on their way to happily ever after. Everything was perfect.

Cynthia's mother, Beverly, was serving as her Maid of Honor. She had girlfriends her age at First State Bank where she was a vice president. But her mom was her closest friend.

I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.",What did the writer think of Timothy after learning about his typical day?,"['Timothy was very hardworking.', 'Timothy was being mistreated.', 'Timothy had a heavy burden.', 'Timothy was enjoying his childhood.']",0,race

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"". ""Billerica"" was the name of a town just north of Boston.",We can infer from the passage that   _  .,"['The writer must have experienced such embarrassment many times', 'The writer had difficulty remembering names because he was getting old', ""Running through the alphabet was always an effective way of remembering an acquaintance's name for the writer"", 'Mrs. Ricca would have named one of her sons ""Bill"" if Billerica was not the name of a town north of Boston']",10,race

I was traveling back home from a family visit, and after treating me to breakfast and filling my car with gas, it was obvious that my dad wanted to make sure that I would be okay on the road.
""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn't always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away. I could always make sure of that.
Even now, almost 30 years later, I treasure knowing that I can pick up the phone and call Dad, and he'll be there for me. I have a wonderful husband, but that hasn't changed how Dad sees me. I'm still his child and he loves to see that my needs are met.
I remember a time when I was shopping in a hardware store   with Dad. I mentioned my plans to paint one wall in my house. Well, that's all it took for Dad to take action. By the time I got to the checkout  line, all the supplies I picked out were put out of my hands and placed with things he bought.
Then there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few "" items"".

As I did I looked very carefully at some of the rooms on this wing of the hospital, and it seemed that almost every bed held an elderly person. Some appeared to be confused, and some just looked lonely. I couldn't help but notice that there was no family there, no one to care them, and no one to reduce the ache of loneliness. My heart broke inside me.
They are aging, with withered   skin on their faces and hands, their eyes look tried, and yet no one notices them.

It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming.

A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity.

""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming.

A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.
In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.
Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.
In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.
Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call?

""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used.

We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon.

Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate.

By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.

George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility.

The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.

race,bert-base-uncased,ONNX-OPT,1036.3779067993164,,583,"What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.

Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.

The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

race,bert-base-uncased,ONNX Quantized,813.8902187347412,,583,"What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century.

A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

race,bert-base-uncased,ONNX Quantized,923.0821132659912,,583,"What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname.

""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball.","According to the text, good books   _  .","['offer as much knowledge as TV does', 'are more entertaining than TV', 'should be made into films', 'cannot be found easily']",40,race

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.
In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.
Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call?

""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level.

Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call?

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level.

Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname.

I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store.

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball.","According to the text, good books   _  .","['offer as much knowledge as TV does', 'are more entertaining than TV', 'should be made into films', 'cannot be found easily']",40,race

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.

We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children.

The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.

Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.
But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn't always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

race,roberta-base,ONNX-OPT,1030.0419330596924,,583,"What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon.

Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.

Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children.

They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

race,roberta-base,ONNX-OPT,1059.2310428619385,,583,"What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.",What did the writer think of Timothy after learning about his typical day?,"['Timothy was very hardworking.', 'Timothy was being mistreated.', 'Timothy had a heavy burden.', 'Timothy was enjoying his childhood.']",0,race

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

""No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!"" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40.

Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball.","According to the text, good books   _  .","['offer as much knowledge as TV does', 'are more entertaining than TV', 'should be made into films', 'cannot be found easily']",40,race

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.",What did the writer think of Timothy after learning about his typical day?,"['Timothy was very hardworking.', 'Timothy was being mistreated.', 'Timothy had a heavy burden.', 'Timothy was enjoying his childhood.']",0,race

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.
I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.
""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons ""Bill"".

One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this.

Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.
In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.
Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.","When a person dies in Bali, it is a common practice to   _  .","['express deep sorrow at his death', 'celebrate the death like a great event', 'sing and dance joyfully in his honor', 'remember what he did in his lifetime']",90,race

I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.
What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.
Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.
Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount).

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.
Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?
I easily remembered his surname, ""Ricca"". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname.

""Bill, how are you doing?"", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.
I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball.","According to the text, good books   _  .","['offer as much knowledge as TV does', 'are more entertaining than TV', 'should be made into films', 'cannot be found easily']",40,race

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules.

Then there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few "" items"". By the time we were finished, my shopping cart was full of groceries from every shelf in the store!

Each member of the family was taking turns sitting with her because of her dementia  . As I did I looked very carefully at some of the rooms on this wing of the hospital, and it seemed that almost every bed held an elderly person. Some appeared to be confused, and some just looked lonely. I couldn't help but notice that there was no family there, no one to care them, and no one to reduce the ache of loneliness. My heart broke inside me.
They are aging, with withered   skin on their faces and hands, their eyes look tried, and yet no one notices them. Could it be that we are far too busy to slow down and give a moment of our time to anyone that may swerve   us off the course we are traveling on? Are we afraid of those who have come before us to pave the way, afraid that they carry some awful disease that if we get too close we might catch it?
Whatever the case may be, one day we will be those same people that we long to avoid. We pay thousands of dollars for staying young, and we may turn up the music to forget the thoughts of getting older. But, try as we might, time and age will catch up with us.
We seem to have come to detest   the elderly. While we once held them in high regard and honor, always enjoying their stories of history, we now see them as a pain, always in our way. Isn't it time we wake up?
So, next time you see a withered hand extended in need, or peer into the eyes of a lonely aging face, don't run or look away.

Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.
On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.
With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.
At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball.","According to the text, good books   _  .","['offer as much knowledge as TV does', 'are more entertaining than TV', 'should be made into films', 'cannot be found easily']",40,race

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.
It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying""It got lost""to""I lost it"". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.
Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.
George Bernard Shaw once said,""People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.""""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,""said Albert Schweitzer.
The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.
The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.""It's not my responsibility,""said the nurse,""because it's a large puddle  .""The housekeeper didn't agree.""Well, it's not mine,""she said,""the puddle is too small.""
The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.""Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?""he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.
So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.",What can we learn about responsibility?,"[""It's of secondary importance to discipline."", ""It's the basic but leading quality in one's life."", 'It has the same requirements for people as discipline.', ""It's the most important factor in building one's character.""]",50,race

They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.
Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.
It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules. Those rules may be childish, but they make sure that every child has a chance to win.",The writer believes that   _  .,"['children should make better rules for their games', 'children should invite grow-ups to play with them', ""children's games can do them a lot of good"", 'children play games without reasons']",60,race

In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.
In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.
Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales. A person in America can purchase a product from a person in Germany, without leaving home.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.
One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.
Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.
In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.
Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.
